# Baby Movement Counter

If you are worried because you think you haven't felt the baby move in what you seem to think is a very long time, but you aren't sure exactly how long. 
Well this app allows to start timer and count your baby movements while the timer is running and it will give you an average of babys' movements per hour. 

This app should help you count babys' movements and keep track of them. 

None of the data is actually recorded and defientyl does not leave your phone so it's all secure with you. 
Future versions might allow for storing history of the movement counts but if that will be the case it will still be all on your phone. 

# Disclaimer 
This is in now way any medical app that you should use to confirm that the baby is moving enough or not. This app has been created for guiding purposes only, the best method to get baby's movement counted is still going to see a medical professional like midwife or a doctor.
